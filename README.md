# wrapped++


As we all know spotify wrapped is the largest celebrated holiday(and most most annoying)  
During this time, many individuals gather around to learn more insight about the music they were listening all year long   
(Even though its mostly either going to be Drake or Taylor Switft)  

## What is this?
Spotify users, can request their extensive listening data which contains songs, albums, timestamps... etc  
Using the pandas library it is possible to replicate the results of spotify wrapped  

## Why is this any different?
While tinkering with my own data, There are some interesting feilds that give a different outcome  
for example while playing around with 'skipped' in the data, you can easily filter songs based that you skipped the most  
Another is using timestamps on the data to ananlyze and seperate songs and albums being played based on time of day, month  
And most important the data spans the entirety of a user's spotify account, in theory you can make a spotify wrap during your early account years(dont its all cringe, and emo)  

## Conclusion
While spotify wrap is an amazing and exciting event to look forward too  
you don't have to wait for November or December of next year to how basic or based your music taste is
